This portfolio showcases my skills as a front-end and full-stack developer, including work in web development, UX design, and UI engineering. The site includes a categorized and filterable portfolio section, grouped skill tags, and smooth UI transitions to enhance user experience. I built this project using React and modular JavaScript to allow for future scalability as I take on more freelance and client work.
